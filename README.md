# TCMS
Turntabl Client Management System (TCMS)

## Requirements
Make sure your terminal is working properly.
And you have java installed. <br> 
If you don't, type this in your terminal to install the latest version: 
## sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre <br>

Get the tcms unto your machine: <br>
put it in a recognised location, that you can easily navigate to, for instance, /Desktop.<br> 
Open your terminal<br>
Navigate to the 'tcms' location from your current location. If it's on your desktop, use the command
## cd Desktop/tcms/ <br>
Check to see if you have the versions directory in it using this command:
## ls
Navigate into the "versions" directory using:
## cd versions/
You can now run the latest version of the application using this command:
## java -jar tcms.1.0.1.jar 

You can check on the previous version using:
## java -jar tcms.1.0.jar
to see the significant changes that have been made (if you want to).
